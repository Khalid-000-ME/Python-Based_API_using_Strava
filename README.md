Instructions to run the project:

1. Open terminal in the current project folder.
2. Type ".venv\Scripts\activate" and hit enter.
3. Run "app.py".
4. Go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000" [Make sure you have logged into my Strava account in order to access the API]

Handling known issues:

1. Use only my Strava account. I have submitted the email ID and password along with the work samples.
2. "Missing data here" - if you keep seeing this, go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/resource_error" check both the checkboxes to use synthetic data and click the "Redirect to Stats Page" button.

Notes:

1. The required packages are already ready inside this virtual environment.
2. Use my Strava account. I have submitted the email ID and password along with the work samples.
3. The flow of the project starts from what shows after a user enter his/her login credentials to access any platform.
4. Still, to access Strava API, we need authorization from Strava, hence the Strava UI pops up in the screen.

Mock data:

1. If the tester does not have real-world data, he/she can use the "Mock data" feature. This is for testing purposes only.
2. Note that ways to access the real-world data has also been implemented in this project if they are existing.
